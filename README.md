# HTR-HNPD
Python scripts on HTR for Historical Non-Preprocessed Documents

This repository provides some preprocessing tools for images intended
to go through an OCR/HTR process. It uses NumPy, Pandas and OpenCV for
that. The scripts lives inside the ImagePreprocessing directory.

It also provides some CNN and CRNN implementations to perform HTR/OCR.
It uses TensorFlow and Keras. The scripts live inside the
SentenceRecognition directory.
